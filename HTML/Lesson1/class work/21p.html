<h1 class="zag1">TWENTY ONE PILOTS</h1>
<p class="par1">Twenty One Pilots (stylized in all lowercase or as twenty øne piløts) is an American musical duo from
    Columbus, Ohio. The band was formed in 2009 by lead vocalist Tyler Joseph along with Nick Thomas and Chris Salih,
    who both left in 2011. Since their departure, the line-up has consisted of Joseph and drummer Josh Dun. The duo is
    best known for their singles "Stressed Out", "Ride", and "Heathens". The group received a Grammy Award for Best Pop
    Duo/Group Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards for "Stressed Out". The band independently released two
    albums, Twenty One Pilots (2009) and Regional at Best (2011), before being signed by record label Fueled by Ramen in
    2012. Their label debut, Vessel, was released in 2013 and became the second album in history on which every track
    received at least a gold certification, making Twenty One Pilots the first band in the history of music to see every
    song on two albums earn gold or platinum awards</p>
